This is my first post for this website. Let me see if this works.

## Technology

This website is build with [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) through [RStudio Desktop](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/), with the static page stored in [Github](https://github.com/akmalf) and served through Netlify.

(Hey the link works!)

Just like any other blogging platform, it can insert pictures:

## Scientific Publishing

But what makes Quarto special is that it is a *scientific and technical publishing system*; so naturally it allow code highlighting:

``` python
for i in range(3):
  print(i)
```

(even if the syntax highlighter is not available for all language of interest, for example, SAS syntax support is missing):

``` sass
proc sql;
create table something as
select * from nothing;
quit;
```

Beyond just highlighting, Quarto can *run* Python and R codes and store the result with ease with `reticulate` package, like so:

```{python}
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

for i in range(3):
  print(i+1)
```

```{r}
for (x in 1:3) {
  print(x)
}
```

## Math

It can also support $math$, like so inline: $x = \dfrac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}$ or the display one: $$
\int_0^\infty e^{-x^2}\: dx = \dfrac{\sqrt{\pi}}{2}
$$

And as you can see in the [About](../../about.html) page (why this one is very hard?), we can also cross-linking and do tables.
